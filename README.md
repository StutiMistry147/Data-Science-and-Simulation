# Data-Science-and-Simulation
## Overview
Welcome to my repository for computational modeling, quantitative analysis, and system verification. This project serves as an evolving sandbox where I apply mathematical frameworks and high-performance computing to solve complex, real-world problems.

## Multi-Language Stack
- <ins>Performance</ins>: C++ for computational heavy-lifting.
- <ins>Analysis</ins>: Python for data science libraries and rapid visualization.
- <ins>Verification</ins>: Promela for system logic and state-space exploration.
- <ins>Automation</ins>: Shell for streamlined workflows and CI/CD logic.

## Future Goals
I am constantly expanding this portfolio. Upcoming areas of exploration include:
- <ins>Machine Learning</ins>: Integrating predictive models into the trading engine.
- <ins>Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)</ins>: Expanding stochastic simulations to multi-agent social systems.
- <ins>Distributed Systems</ins>: Further formal verification of cloud-based architectures.
